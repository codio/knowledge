Gigaboxes
=========

Codio's default boxes are allocated 756 MB of memory. If larger boxes are needed, you can upgrade your subscription to get access to 1-GB, 2-GB, 4-GB, 8-GB, 16-GB and GPU (for GPU-accelerated instances) boxes.

You purchase a specific number of Gigaboxes that can be used by anyone in your organization. Codio tracks usage based on active projects rather than total projects. In other words, you can have 100 projects which use a Gigabox but as long as only one is active at a time, this requires only a single gigabox unit to be purchased.

You must first request a larger box for your organization. Contact help@codio.com to initiate this discussion.
