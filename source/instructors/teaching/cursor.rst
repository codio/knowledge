Cursor Presence
===============


When accessing a students assignment, all active users in a project/assignment will be shown with a color in an icon showing in the menu bar when files are being accessed/edited

Clicking on the icon will change focus to show what that user is currently editing highlighted in that color and will show the users cursor. 
Hovering over the icon will show the filename and line currently being edited.
