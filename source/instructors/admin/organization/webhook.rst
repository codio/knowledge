Webhooks
========
Webbhooks allow receiving Codio events by calling your endpoint. 

The system won’t retry webhook calls for any missed events you can query the API event object using loadEvents function.

You can add your own Webhooks to your Codio organization from the **Organization > Integrations** page in Codio.

Go to the **Webhooks** area and **Add Webhook**

To add a webhook enter the URL of your server and press create, the system will send a test request to check endpoint validity.

All requests contain a JWT signature you can verify using codio keys https://apollo.codio.com/lti/oidc/certs (or https://apollo.codio.co.uk/lti/oidc/certs if working on codio.co.uk)


Example app to receive webhooks into a Codio project can be found here: https://github.com/iyashtykov/webhook-server
