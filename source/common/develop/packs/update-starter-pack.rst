Update a Starter Pack
=====================
When you edit your Starter Pack, the **Source** field is enabled if you are the owner of the source project and the project has not been deleted. If someone else owns the project or if you have deleted the underlying project, you can still edit the project data fields below the **Source** field and the original project that was used will be retained.

If you need to make changes to your Starter Pack, follow these steps:

1. Create a new project from your Starter Pack or locate an existing project where you want to use your Starter Pack.
2. Locate the Starter Pack  and click **Edit**.
3. In the **Source** field, browse to the correctly configured project.
4. Click Create**** in the lower portion of the page.

.. Note:: Codio does not support versioning for Starter Packs.

2. Click **Remove**.
3. On the confirmation dialog, click **Yes** to confirm the delete. 

.. Note:: Any projects that were created from a Starter Pack will not be impacted.
