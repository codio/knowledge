Add or Remove Organization Owners
===================================
The organization creator automatically becomes the **Owner**. You can grant **Owner** permissions to other people who need administrative access. This can be done by either adding a new user directly as an **Owner** or by upgrading an existing user's permissions to **Owner** level. Below are step-by-step instructions for both methods. Note that only current Owners can designate new Owners.


Adding a New User as an Owner
------------------------------

**Follow these steps to add a new user to the Owners group in your organization:**

1. Click your username in the top-right corner, then select **Organization** from the menu.

2. In the **Organizations** tab, click the name of your organization.

5. Click **Send Invite**.

   An email is sent to the teacher that contains a link to sign up. Upon completing the sign up process, they are added to your organization as an Owner.

   .. Note:: They must use the email address the invitation was sent to for sign up or they will not be added to the organization.

  All pending invitations are displayed and you have the option to **Resend** or **Revoke** the invitation. 


Adding an Existing User as an Owner

4. Click **Owners** and click the **Add Owner** button at the bottom. The person you are adding must already be a member of the organization. If they are not, use the process above to invite them to the organization as an owner.

5. Click **OK**.

Removing Owners
----------------
You can remove a user from your organization's Owners group, but you must always have at least one Owner. Removing a user from the Owners group does not remove them from the organization but from the **Owner** role. Below are the step-by-step instructions on how to remove a user from the Owners group:

1. Click your username in the top-right corner, then select **Organization** from the menu.

2. In the **Organizations** tab, click the name of your organization.
