5. Click the **X** next to the assessment you want to permanently delete.

.. Note:: You can restore a deleted assessment, if it is still on the Assessments tab, by clicking on the name and copying the unique identification (see image below). For this example, the line in your guide will be: ``{Check It!|assessment}(multiple-choice-1735957228)``.
