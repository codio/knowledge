Course Action Data
==================
You can create a report of all course management activities for all courses in your organization. Examples of the types of activities you will find in the report are rearranging student groups, resetting assignments, regrading, and adding teachers.

.. Note:: The collection of this data began in June 2025; prior data is not available.

1. Click your username in the top-right corner, then select **Organization** from the menu.

2. In the **Organizations** tab, click the name of your organization.

3. Click the **Course Action Data** tab.


Select the **Duration** for the report, which can range from 1 week to 12 months, and then click **Export**.

Generated reports will be available for download in the **Available Course Action Data Reports** section. They are retained for 3 days and then are deleted. If you miss downloading it during that window, you will have to regenerate the report.
