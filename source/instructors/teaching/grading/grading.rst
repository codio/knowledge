Grading process
---------------
Once students have completed their assignments, they notify the teacher by using the **Education > Mark as Completed** menu in the IDE. Instructors can also mark the assignment as complete or change the status to incomplete. Follow these steps to view and grade the assignments:

1. Open the assignment and view the students that have a green check mark to the left of their name. This indicates that they have marked as complete.

Information on all students that require grading for all assignments in the course can be seen from the course **Queue** area in the **Grading** section.

By default the Grading Queue displays all students' submission that require grading, organized by module/assignment but using the Do Not Group button you can swap to view the queue where the list is sorted by submission time, with the oldest submission at the top but other filters can be set as required.

- Points
- Grade
- Time
- Graded


As explained in the previous section, once you open a student's submission then you can use **Next**, **Previous**, **Next Ungraded** and **Previous Ungraded** buttons to move to the next/previous student submission or next/previous ungraded assessment in that specific assignment.

Override Grade
--------------

If the students assignment has already been graded, another teacher in the course can click **Override Grade** to manually change the grade with additional comments.

The **Override Grade** feature can also be used to provide comments at the assignment level. If you do not wish to alter the numeric grade when adding assignment level comments, re-enter it under **Grade**, add your comment and then select **Done.**
