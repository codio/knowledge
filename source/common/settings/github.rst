3. Navigate to the GitHub section and click **Upload Public Key**.

You will be redirected to your application account and asked to authorize the application. You will then be redirected back to your Codio account.

You can remove your connection by clicking **Remove Connection**.

.. Note:: If you need to connect to a different account, see :ref:`SSH Key <ssh-key>` where you can get your Codio Public SSH Key and then add manually to your new repo account.
