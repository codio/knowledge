Search Assessments Library
==========================

You search an assessment library the same whether you are using Codio's :ref:`Global Assessment Library <global-library>` or your :ref:`organization assessment library <org-library>`. Follow these steps to search a library:

1. In the Guide Editor, click the **Add Assessments** drop-down menu and choose **Assessment Library**.

3. To narrow the assessments that are displayed, enter a tag and value pair. For example, you can search by the **Programming Language** (tag) and indicate you want **Python** (value) questions. The search is not case sensitive and Codio presents auto-complete suggestions as you type.

   You can also click any of the tag fields in the results to automatically filter and add a new row (click +) to your search query. You can add as many tag:value pairs as needed to narrow your search.
