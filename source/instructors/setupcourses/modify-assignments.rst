Modify Assignments
==================
You can make changes to assignments that have already been published but they are not available to students until you re-publish it. There are certain considerations when making changes to assignments that students have already started to avoid invalidating their work. You can also reset assignments so that your students have the latest version.

Follow these steps to modify an assignment and re-publish it:

1. On the **Courses** page, click the course that contains the assignment you want to edit.
2. Click on the **Edit Assignments** tab and expand the module and click the assignment to open it. If there is a more recent version published than your working copy, a message will be shown offering you the option to open your current version or the last published version.
3. Click the assignment and make your changes to the assignment (see below).
4. When you have completed your changes, click **Publish** in the upper right corner of the assignment or from the **Education** menu area
5. Enter a description of your updates in the **Change Log** and then click **Publish**.

.. Note:: If you wish to discard the changes you have made in your working copy, go to **Project > Discard Changes** to revert back to the last published version.

Re-publish assignment that students have already started
--------------------------------------------------------
When you make changes to an assignment and attempt to re-publish it, if students have already started the assignment, you are warned that **Students have started this assignment** and provide options for you to continue. You can add new files but cannot update existing files as it will invalidate the student's work.
