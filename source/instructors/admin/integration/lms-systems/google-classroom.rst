    5.  Select **Connect Class** button for the Google class you wish to connect your Codio course to. ​ 
    
    |Connect to Codio| 
    
    Your Codio Course is now integrated with your Google Class. 
    
.. Note:: Google classrooms do not support the ordering of modules/assignments from the Codio Course, they will be generated randomly but can easily be reordered from the **Classwork** tab in your Google Class 

Authentication and account creation

9. To remove the integration link between Codio and your Google Classroom ​ 

- Go to the **LTI/LMS** area in the course
