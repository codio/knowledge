Generating Assessments With AI
==============================
Important points to consider when auto-generating assessments:

- The assessment generator will use the text on the current page to generate the assessment.

- You should always review the generated assessment for correctness, including the question prompt, button text, expected output and generated code solutions. 

- You can edit the assessment contents once they have been generated.

- Review the items on the Execution and Grading tabs, as the default settings may not match your needs. 

- The regenerate option is not available for existing assessments. However, you can create a new assessment to replace an existing one. 

- When there is insufficient information, the assessment generator may output incorrect information. It is very important to always review generated assessments carefully.

This is a new feature, and if it does not work properly for you, please let us know via the support chat or by emailing help@codio.com. If you would like us to take a look, send us your course name, the module, the assignment, and the page.

.. note:: Not all assessments can be AI-generated. If you don't see a "Generate" button in the bottom right corner when you click on an assessment, that assessment type does not support AI generation.

4. When you are satisfied with the result, press **Apply** and then **Create**.


.. important:: The generate assessment feature does not configure the page :ref:`layout; <layout>` you should specify the layout depending on how you want to present the information to the students.




Example Prompts
----------------
**Multiple choice**

- Create a question about how to refactor the code below with multiple correct answers: (include code)

**Parson's Problem**

- Create a Python script that reads a text file named 'input.txt' and rewrites its content to 'output.txt' with each sentence on a separate line. Assume sentences end with '.', '!', or '?'. 

**Fill in the Blanks**

- List different government cybersecurity recommendations and have the student specify which agency recommended them and or what year they were recommended.

**Standard Code Test**

- Provide the student with simple instructions, including the formula used to calculate compound interest. Students should use standard input to prompt for input values.
