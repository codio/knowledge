Modify Question from Global Assessment Library
----------------------------------------------
If you like a question in the Assessments Library but want to modify it, :ref:`unlink <unlink-assessment>` the question from the library and then modify it for your assignment.

You can then add your new version of the assessment to your organization's assessment library. For more information on creating an organization assessments library see :ref:`Organization Assessments Library <org-library>`.
