Join a Course
-------------

You can join a course directly from your LMS platform (such as Canvas, Blackboard, Moodle, etc.), or use a URL or token provided by your instructor.

If your school is not using an LMS platform, your instructor will provide you one of the following methods to join the course:

- Send you an invitation URL that you can copy and paste into your browser.

- Send you a multi-word token that you can enter on the Codio website using `Join Course <https://codio.com/p/join-class>`_. Enter the token, then click **Next**.
