LLM-Based Rubric Grader
=======================
You can find the **LLM Based Rubric** assessment in the **Manually Graded** section of the Assessments tab. More information about adding assessments can be found in :ref:`our assessment documentation <add-assessment>`.

There are three steps to this process. 

- Rubric generation
- LLM-based grading using the generated rubric
- Teacher approval of LLM-generated grades


LLM-Based Rubric Creation
-------------------------

Add an **LLM Based Rubric** assessment to your guide page and follow the steps below.

- Add a solution file (1) if you wish the rubric creation process to consider your solution.

- Then, click the **Generate Rubrics** (2) button to initiate the process.

The **Rubric Creation Agent** uses the following items to generate the rubric items:

- The assessment name
- Instructions provided in the **General** tab of the assessment
- Content of the Guide Page where the assessment is being added
- Contents of the provided solution file
- The Course, Module, and Assignment name
- Requirements specified in the Rubric creation tab

- You can add your requirements in the **Rubrics Requirements** dialog.

- Once you are done, click **Generate Using AI**. Note: You are not required to add anything to this dialog; the process will also use general code grading norms to supply rubric items.

- You can provide additional rubric items by clicking **Add Rubric** and entering information.

- Once you have reviewed the rubric items and other settings, click **Save** to save the assessment.


LLM Grading Based on the Created Rubric 
---------------------------------------

The LLM Grading agent uses the following to grade the student work:

- Instructions provided in the **General** tab of the assessment
- Contents of the Guide page where the assessment is located
- Contents of the specified solution file
- The student file
- The rubric generated in the previous step to identify the grading criteria

The grading occurs when the student clicks the **Check It** button. The student receives information about whether they have passed or failed each rubric item, but does not see the rest of the LLM-generated feedback until after the instructor conducts their review.

Manual Approval by Instructor 
-----------------------------
The final step involves the instructor opening the student assignment and selecting the passing test cases as part of the :ref:`grading process <grading>`. The instructor can also edit the comments generated by the LLM. Once this process is complete, click on **Apply Grade**.
