SPLICE Assessments
==================

SPLICE (Standards, Protocols, and Learning Infrastructure for Computing Education) provides a protocol for information exchange between the assessment and the application in which it is embedded. To use a SPLICE assessment, provide a link to the assessment, and Codio will display it in an iframe. More information about SPLICE assessments may be found here: https://cssplice.org/.

.. note:: The assessment portion of a SPLICE assessment is created outside of Codio. 

How to Use a SPLICE Assessment in Codio
---------------------------------------

For more information on **Metadata** (Optional) and **Files** (Optional) see :ref:`Assessments <assessments>`.


1. On the **General** page, enter the name of your assessment that describes the test. This name is displayed in the teacher dashboard so the name should reflect the challenge and thereby be clear when reviewing.

2. On the **Execution** page, paste the URL for the assessment in the **ASSESSMENT URL** field.

3. On the **Grading** page, enter the number of points the student should receive for correctly answering the assessment. You can choose any positive numeric value. If this is an ungraded assessment, enter zero (0).

- **Use maximum score** - Toggle to enable assessment final score to be the highest score attained of all runs.

4. Click **Create** to complete the process.
