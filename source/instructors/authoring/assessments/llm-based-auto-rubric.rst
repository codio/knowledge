LLM-Rubric AutoGrade
====================

Codio has provided two versions of the **LLM-Based Rubric Grader**. One requires the instructor to approve the LLM-generated feedback, and the other automatically displays it to the student.

The **LLM Rubric Autograde** assessment is in the **Auto-Graded** section of the assessments menu and the :ref:`LLM Rubric <llm-based-rubric>` assessment is in the **Manually Graded** section.
More information about adding assessments can be found in our :ref:`assessment documentation <add-assessment>`.

There are two steps to the **LLM Rubric Autograde** process:

1. Rubric generation
2. LLM-based grading using the generated rubric


Add an **LLM Rubric Autograde** assessment to your guide page and follow the steps below.
