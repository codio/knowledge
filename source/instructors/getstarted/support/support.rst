Codio Support
=============

If you need support, then the most effective way is to use our integrated support system. You will find this in the dashboard and the IDE.

Dashboard
*********
Support is available in the dashboard by clicking on the **Help** menu item at the top and selecting **Support Chat**.

IDE
***

Support is available within the IDE from the **Help** menu item, then **Support**.

Support Dialog
**************
There is a support dialog that appears when you invoke the support option. This tracks all conversations and threads you have had with Codio and where you can also start a new conversation.

If you are in Codio, you can see when a reply to your query arrives even if you have closed the support dialog box

An email will also be sent to you if you do not see the reply within 2 minutes or have logged out of your Codio account

Feedback
********

We are always interested to hear from our users about their thoughts/ideas for future improvements. To raise an idea or vote on other ideas already raised, either select **Feedback** from the **Connect** menu at the top or go to `Codio Feedback <https://feedback.codio.com>`_ directly.

Community
*********

The Codio community forum is a place for Codio users to engage with each other and share best practices. You can access it from the Connect menu or go to `Codio Community <https://community.codio.com/>`_ directly.

This forum does not replace our in-product customer support chat or our help center, please continue to use the support chat for product issues, and refer to our help center for product use guidance.

Student Support
***************
You can set a Contact URL for your students at the organization level, see :ref:`Organization Contact URL <org-contact-url>` and/or at the course level, see :ref:`Course Contact URL <course-contact-url>` so they can raise questions directly to your preferred area.

If you set the contact URL for a course, this will override any contact URL you may have set at the organization level.

Students will then be given the option to report a problem, ask a question related to their course work or access Codio support if they have a problem accessing the Codio platform.

**N.B. "Teacher" accounts will not be effected by this setting and they will still be able to contact Codio in the usual manner.**
