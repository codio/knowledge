====================

You can restart or reset your project's box from the **Project** menu.

Reset
-----
Resetting a box will delete data and configurations permanently. When performing a box reset, the box is returned to a fresh state but your code files are untouched. It also results in the following:

- Any new folders or files that have been created will be deleted.
- All parts of the box outside the **~/workspace** folder will be reset.
- All code files in the **~/workspace** folder are untouched.
- Box restart.

After a Reset, you must reinstall components (npm modules, ruby gems, etc.) and other modifications you may have made.

**Note:** Students can also reset their assignments from the **Education** tab and choose **Reset Assignment**.
