Pin and Unpin Assignment
========================
When an assignment is pinned, it is displayed in the upper portion of the student dashboard. Typically, the assignment you are currently teaching is pinned so students can easily access it, and then unpinned when the course is completed. 

Note: Only four assignments can be pinned at any time.
