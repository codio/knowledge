Allow Regrade Request
=====================

You can allow students to request for a regrade of their assignments. This gives students an opportunity to voice concerns about their grades while enabling teachers to address those concerns transparently. It also fosters a more collaborative learning environment.

To allow students to request regrades, follow these steps:

1. Open the assignment **Settings**.
2. In the **Assignment** settings, enable **Allow Regrade Request by Student**.
3. Click **Save Changes**.

+The regrade request option will be available to students only after their assignments are marked complete and graded, and grades are released.

Once a student requests a regrade, all teachers in the course will receive a notification email by default. If you don't want all teachers to receive these emails, you can turn off notifications or customize recipients in the **Grading/Basic Settings** tab. Regrade requests will also appear in the grading queue and on the assignment progress page.

From this grading dialog, you can: 

- Open the student's project using the **Open Project** button
- **Override Grade** of the student (once you override the grade, the regrade request will be automatically removed)
- **Reject** the regrade request with a message for the student

.. note:: If you have enabled resubmission after marking as complete, students will automatically be prompted to request a regrade when they resubmit their work.
