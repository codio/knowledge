1. Enter the number of student licenses required.

2. Enter the student start date. 

3. If you have a promotion code, enter it in the appropriate field. Validation is case insensitive.

-  If the promotion code is invalid, the message
   ``Invalid promotion code`` will be shown
-  If the promotion code has expired, the message
   ``This promotion code has expired`` will be shown
-  Promotion codes are only available for new users and not available for student pay plans.

4. Enter a billing email address.

5. The plans available will be shown (semester or annual), select the plan you require and if you require the invoice to be sent to someone else, you can change the recipient.

6. When you are ready, click the 'Generate Invoice' button or 'Generate Quote' button as per your requirement, and the invoice or quote will be generated and sent to the email address.

  .. Note:: You can access your invoice from the email, or you can click **View Invoice** from the **Invoice History** section. Pay your invoice at this link.


Student Pay
-----------
The option to switch to a **Student Pay plan** where students are prompted to enter a credit card when they sign up is also available. Be aware if you have an annual plan and have already paid, this might lead to a conflict.

1. Navigate to the **Billing** page in your organization.

2. Click **Switch to Student Pay.** It will prompt you to confirm this action.

3. Students will now be prompted to make a payment when they access their Codio account, whether it be from Codio or from your LMS. 

4. To support students in this process, provide them with `this documentation link <https://docs.codio.com/students/accessing-codio/paying.html#pay-for-codio-subscription>`__ with specific emphasis to `this section <https://docs.codio.com/students/accessing-codio/paying.html#problems-setting-up-a-new-subscription-plan>`__ in the event they have problems especially if this may be first time they are trying to purchase online and the transaction may be refused by their bank due to the ever increasing fraud prevention measures card issuers are implementing or guide them to contact help@codio.com.  

Bookstore Pay (Access Codes)
----------------------------
Codio offers the option to provide licenses through your institution's campus bookstore. This enables students, especially those using financial aid, to purchase an access code directly from the bookstore. The access code serves as the Codio license. When students first access their Codio account, they simply enter the access code to activate their license.

Only one access code is required per student even if the student is enrolled in multiple courses. Instructors provide students with information on how to use the code, and additional guidance is available on each student's page. Note, the setup is institution specific.

Any unsold access codes will remain active and can be used in subsequent semesters.

**1. Determining License Requirements**

- Determine the number of licenses required based on expected student enrollment
- Select the appropriate subscription type:

+---------------------+-------------------+
| Subscription Type   | ISBN              |
+=====================+===================+
| 1-Semester          | 978-1-7331872-5-1 |
+---------------------+-------------------+
| 2-Semester          | 978-1-7331872-8-2 |
+---------------------+-------------------+
| Annual              | 978-1-7331872-1-3 |
+---------------------+-------------------+

**2. Ordering Process**

- Communicate the number of licenses required and subscription type to your bookstore.
- The bookstore places an email order with this information to accounts@codio.com including a purchase order if required.

Upon receipt of the order, Codio will issue:

- A printable pdf letter to give to each student purchasing a code, providing instructions for code use.
- A CSV file listing all the access code numbers issued in the order.
- An invoice for the codes purchased, payable within 30 days of the invoice date.

**3. Bookstore Management Guidelines**

- Each access code should only be sold once.
- Access codes never expire and are not course specific, allowing them to be sold in future semesters.
- Bookstores should  manage the codes like physical stock and can place additional code orders at any time.
- Codes are non-refundable.
