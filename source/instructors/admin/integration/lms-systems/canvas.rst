LTI 1.1 Setup
==============

Integrating with Canvas using LTI App
-------------------------------------
**This method is recommended.**

The **Codio LTI App** method allows for an easy way to integrate and to map Codio course assignments to Canvas. Access the directions at :ref:`LTI App(LTI 1.1 Only) <lti-app>` page. If you are not able to use the LTI App, follow the manual integration directions below. 

.. Note:: Configuring your LTI settings using the LTI App is only for the US version of Codio. It will not work with Codio UK (codio.co.uk).

+--------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


Course LMS URL
--------------
This URL ensures that Codio knows how to redirect students back to the correct Canvas course should they attempt to access the course through their dashboard. You need to perform the following actions one time only for a course. The Canvas user who carries out these steps does not need to be a system administrator but must have suitable privileges to edit courses and assignments.

17.  In Codio, go to your course and click on the **LTI/LMS** tab.
18.  Go to the **LTI/LMS Settings** area.
19.  At the top is a switch **Enable LTI** which you should check is enabled.
20.  Below this is an empty field **Course LMS URL**. Switch back to Canvas and make sure you are on the Home page of the course. Copy the url in the address bar of your browser to the clipboard and paste it into the above mentioned field in Codio. The url format should end with something like ``/courses/1121212`` although the number will be different.

Mapping an Assignment to a Canvas Assignment
--------------------------------------------

The final mapping step needs to be taken for each individual assignment within Codio. It maps a Canvas assignment to a Codio assignment.

In Canvas
~~~~~~~~~

21.  Make sure you are in the Courses area.
22.  Click on the **Assignments** link in the left hand side.
23.  Provide a name for the Assignment.
24.  Set the points for the Assignment. When the grades get passed back later, the Codio percentage score will be scaled to the points value you specify here.

.. figure:: /img/lti/canvas-submission-type.png
   :alt: Canvas Submission
   :align: right
   :figwidth: 300px

25. Scroll down and look for the **Submission Type** field. 

26.  You should now click on the dropdown list and select **External Tool**.
27.  Specify the assignment using one of the two options: 

    - **Add by Resource Selection Preview (recommended)**
        
        - Click the **Find** button.
        - Click the Codio tool.
        - Select the assignment you want to map to your course in Canvas. 
        
    - **Add by LTI Integration URL**
    
        - Return to Codio and navigate to the course. Ensure you are in **Teach** mode. 
        - To the right of the assignment, click the icon with 3 blue dots and select **LTI Integration URL**. You should copy the LTI integration url to the clipboard by clicking on the field (it will auto copy).
        - Paste the **LTI Integration URL** in the URL field under **Enter or find an External Tool URL.**

28.  Select **Load This Tool In a New Tab**.
29.  Click the **Save and Publish** button.
30.  Make sure the Canvas course is published.

Common Cartridge
----------------

In the Canvas course you have created go to **Settings** and **Import Course Content** and select **Common Cartridge 1 x Package** and proceed to upload the **.ismcc** file.

If using the Common Cartridge file to import the Codio course assignment details into Canvas, each assignment needs mapping as above using the **Add by Resource Selection Preview (recommended)** method noted above.
