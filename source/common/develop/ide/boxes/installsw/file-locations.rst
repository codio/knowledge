File and Software Locations
===========================

All Codio code workspace and software dependency files are located in the `/home/codio` folder, also reachable as `~`.

Everything below this level can be accessed but is read-only. You should not change anything below this level because it will not persist.

Software that you install from the command line or using the **Install Software** option is installed in the usual location for an Ubuntu server. 

Code workspace files
--------------------
The code workspace you see in the project file tree is located at `/home/codio/workspace` or `~/workspace`.
