Archive Course
==============
To help manage the number of courses visible to instructors, you can archive courses so they are no longer visible on the **Active** page. When a course is archived, it is moved to the **Archived** page and is read-only. Students can still see their grades/feedback but they cannot continue working on assignments in an archived course. You can move an archived course back to the **Active** page at any time.

To archive a course, follow these steps:

1. On the **Courses** page, click the **Active** tab if it's not already selected.
2. Click the menu on the right side of the course (3 horizontal dots) and choose and choose **Archive Course**.
3. In the confirmation dialog, enter **make read-only** and click **Yes**.

To move an archived course to the **Active** page, follow these steps:

1. On the **Courses** page, click the **Archived** tab.
2. Click the menu on the right side of the course (3 horizontal dots) and choose and choose **Unarchive Course**.

.. Note:: Courses will also automatically archive when the end date set for the course is reached. This date can be amended in the course details area if you require the course to continue to be active
