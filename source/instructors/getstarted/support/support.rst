Support Dialog
**************
There is a support dialog that appears when you invoke the support option. This tracks all conversations and threads you have had with Codio and where you can also start a new conversation.

If you are in Codio, you can see when a reply to your query arrives even if you have closed the support dialog box.

If you don't see a reply within two minutes—or if you're logged out—you'll receive an email notification.

Student Support
***************

You can set a Contact URL for your students at the organization level (see :ref:`Organization Contact URL <org-contact-url>`) and/or at the course level (see :ref:`Course Contact URL <course-contact-url>`) so they can raise questions directly in your preferred channel.

If you set the contact URL for a course, this will override any contact URL you may have set at the organization level.

Students will then be given the option to report a problem, ask a question related to their coursework, or access Codio support if they have a problem accessing the Codio platform.


 

 .. note::
    N.B. "Teacher" accounts will not be affected by this setting, and they will still be able to contact Codio in the usual manner.
