4. You can view members by the group to which they belong (Owners, Test Students, Teachers, Students, and Users without course).

  - **Owners** - Users with the Admin role.
  - **Test Students** - Demo student accounts created with your organization.
  - **Teachers** - Instructors who have registered with your organization. You can also set a teacher account to read only where they only have access to courses in Teaching mode; they cannot add, edit, or delete any content in a course. 

    To set a teacher as read only, toggle their status to **Read Only**.

  - **Students** - Students who have registered for courses in your organization.
  - **Users without course** - All users that are not members of a course as a result of a course being deleted or because a new user has joined your organization but is not yet a Teacher or a Student in a course.
   
5. Click the trash icon, on the right hand side, for users you want to remove from your organization.

   .. Note:: Removing users from your organization does not delete their Codio account. Only the account owner can :ref:`delete users <remove-org-members>`.
