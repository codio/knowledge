Blueprints for Guide Pages
==========================

Use Blueprints to save your Markdown content and **Layout** settings as reusable templates for guide pages. When creating new pages, you can apply these Blueprints to maintain consistent styling and formatting across all your guides.

.. Note:: Blueprints are stored in courses and are available to all assignments in a course. They cannot be used in standalone projects.

Creating a **Blueprint**
------------------------
1. Enter instructions you might use every time on the Guide page.
