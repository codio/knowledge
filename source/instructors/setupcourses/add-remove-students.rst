   - Copy the multi-word token and send it to your students. Ask them to go to `Join Course <https://codio.com/p/join-class>`_ on the Codio website, enter the token, and then sign in or create a Codio account.
    
   - Copy the URL and send to your students. Instruct them to simply click the URL and register their Codio account.
   
   .. Note:: We recommend the Student Invite URL option because students can simply open the URL to join the correct course in your organization.
      
   The students who have been added are displayed on the **Students** page for the course.

    .. Note:: Students cannot be enrolled while the organization is in trial mode. Please ensure your organization has an active subscription before adding students.
    
Add Test Students
-----------------
You may view your course using the special student accounts Codio creates for you. There are three test student accounts within your organization that allow you to view content from the student perspective. 

1. Navigate to the **Courses** page and select the course to open it.
2. Click the **Students** tab and click the **Add a student** button.
3. Click on the **Add test students** button. You will now see three test students displayed on the **Students** page for the course. 
4. Now that you have added test students, you are able to log in as one of the test students by pressing the **Login as** button. Please note that this is only available for the special test student accounts. 

 .. Note:: When logged in as a test student, you will see a bar at the top of the window indicating you are logged in as a test student. You can switch back to your main teacher account by selecting **Switch back to teacher's account**.

   .. Note:: These actions do not remove your student entirely from your organization and any/all data for them in the course is not deleted. If/when they rejoin the course, all their data will be available.  To remove a student entirely from your organization, when all their data will also be deleted, see - :ref:`remove members <remove-org-members>`.
