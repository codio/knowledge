.. _course-revoke-sudo:

Revoke sudo access for all assignments in the course
====================================================

The **Revoke sudo access** is used to prevent students from installing unauthorized software packages in any assignment in a course.

To revoke sudo access, follow these steps:

1. On the **Courses** page, select the course and then click the **Course Details** tab.

2. In the **Course Access** section at the bottom, toggle the **Revoke Sudo Access** button and then **Save Changes**.

To reinstate sudo access, toggle the **Revoke Sudo Access** button and then **Save Changes**.

.. Note:: The settings will be inherited to any :ref:`child course<parent-child-courses>` subsequently created from the parent course.

.. Note:: If students have already started the assignment(s), this setting will only be applied after their assignment is restarted/reset.
