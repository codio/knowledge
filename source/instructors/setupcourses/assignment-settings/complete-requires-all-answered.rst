Complete Requires All Questions Answered
========================================
The **Complete Requires All Questions Answered** setting ensures that all questions have been answered before a student can mark an assignment as complete. By default, this setting is off and must be enabled to activate this behavior.

If a student attempts to **Mark as Complete** before answering all the questions, a dialog will be displayed with a list of the pages containing uncompleted assignments. The student can then click on the name to navigate to the relevant page.

This setting is overridden if an instructor, a timer, or a due date initiates **Mark as Complete**. In these cases, the assignment will be marked as complete even if there are unanswered questions.

To enable or disable this featre, follow these steps:

1. Open the assignment **Settings**.
2. In the **Assignment** settings, toggle on **Complete Requires All Questions Answered** to enable. 

   To disable the setting, toggle off **Complete Requires All Questions Answered**. 

3. Click **Save Changes**.
