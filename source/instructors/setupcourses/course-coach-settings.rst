Extension Settings for a Course
===============================

From the **Extensions** tab in the **Admin** section of your Course menu, you can enable Codio :ref:`Virtual Coach <virtual-coach>` extensions and custom :ref:`organization extensions <org-extensions>` at the course level.
    
.. important:: Extensions enabled at the course level cannot be disabled at the assignment level. If you prefer selective enablement per assignment, use the :ref:`bulk assignment update <bulk-assignment-update>` feature or configure extensions for each assignment.
