Teacher only content can be viewed by teachers when:

- opening a assignment within a course module in a course
- :ref:`viewing student code <viewing-student-work>` within a course



Warning

- If your project is public and a user accesses this project via the public listing of your account they will have access to the solutions.

You can make Guides content available only to course teachers in the following ways:


Setting an entire page as teacher only content
