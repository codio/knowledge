Restore current files
---------------------

There may be times when you want to make changes to your work or discard some of it. The easiest way to accomplish this is to restore the original files in a assignment.

1. Open the assignment that you want to restore.

2. In the upper right corner, click the **Settings** icon and choose **Restore current files**.

**Note:** If this does not accomplish what you intended, contact your instructor to have them reset the assignment to its default state so you can restart it.
