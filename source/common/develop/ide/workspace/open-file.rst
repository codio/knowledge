Open a File
===========

To open a file, simply navigate to the file and select it in the left
Filetree. When you open a file, it appears in a tab in the currently
active `Panel </project/ide/panels/panels>`__.

Codio applies syntax highlighting based on the file type, which is
displayed in the lower status bar. If you want to change the syntax
highlighting to another language format, click the file type in the
lower right corner and choose another language from the list.
