1. You will see all students in your course displayed on this screen. Find the student that you want to remove from the course and click on the blue triple dot icon to the right of their name. Choose **Remove student** to take them out of the course. (Note: this does not remove your student entirely from your organization - if you wish to do this, see :ref:`Remove Members <remove-org-members>`)
