Grade Weights
=============

The **Grade Weights** settings are used to enable and disable the grading model to be used: Teachers Grading, Assessments Grading, or Script Grading, and to manage the grading weight.

The total grade is based on the grade weight assigned to each option: 

  - If only one option is enabled, 100 percent of the points of that option go to the final grade.
  
  - If the enabled options have the same weight, the final grade is calculated as an even split in weight between the enabled options.

    - In the case of all three grading options enabled, each with the same weight, each option has a weight of 1/3.
    - In the case of two grading options enabled, each with the same weight, each option has a weight of 1/2.
    
- If the enabled options have the different weights, the final grade is calculated as a fraction of the enabled options. For example, if **Teachers Grading** has a grading weight of 2 and **Assessments Grading** has a grading weight of 1, the final grade is calculated as **Teachers Grading** points * 2/3 + **Assessments Grading** points * 1/3.

To specify Grade Weights, follow these steps:
---------------------------------------------
1. Navigate to your course, and go to the **Overview** area. 
2. Select the **settings** gear to the right of the assignment name. 
3. Under assignment settings, scroll all the way down. 
4. In the **Grade Weights** area, click the grading options you want to enable and assign the grading weights to each option:

  - **Teachers Grading** - This option allows you to specify a :ref:`Grading Rubric Template <grade-template>` to use with an assignment and specify the grading weight.

    - Click **Teachers Grading** and enter a value in the **Grading Weight** field.
    - Click **Rubics** to assign a grading rubic template to the assignment and then choose the rubic template from the drop-down list.

  - **Assessments Grading** - If your assignment includes :ref:`auto-graded assessments <add-assessment>`, this option is enabled by default. If you do not want the results of the assessments to be included in the grading, disable this option.

    - Click **Assessments Grading** and enter a value in the **Grading Weight** field.

  - **Script Grading** - This option allows you to specify an auto-grade script that runs when the assignment is :ref:`marked as complete <mark-assignment-complete>`. 

    - Click **Script Grading** and enter a value in the **Grading Weight** field. Assign it a weight out of 10 or 100 that has the desired proportion to the “Assessments Grading” weight.
    - Click **Set Custom Script Path** and choose the path from the drop-down list. The “Set Custom Script Path” drop down menu will contain the autograde scripts you set up using the **Education Menu** in your assignment. Select the script you want to use for the assignment. Note: The “Set Custom Script Path” drop down only lets you run one script. You will need a helper script if you want to combine multiple tests.
   
   For more information about assignment level scripts, see :ref:`Using Assignment Level Scripts <auto-grade-scripts>`.
   
5. Make sure to **Save Changes**.
6. To force your Assignment level script to run, select :ref:`Actions <assignment-actions>` and **Run autograde script**.
