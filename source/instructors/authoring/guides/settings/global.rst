Use Submit Buttons
******************
For a discussion on the use of this feature, please :ref:`click here <student-submission>`.

This setting is enabled by default and provides students with a button on :ref:`assessments <assessments>` for them to submit their answers. To suppress the submit buttons, this can be disabled.
If you have set the :ref:`assignment duration <assignment-duration>`, when the end of assignment duration date/time is reached, all answers to the assessments will be automatically submitted.

Use Mark as Complete
********************
For a discussion on the use of this feature, please :ref:`click here <student-submission>`.

This setting is enabled by default. Students will be able to mark an assignment as complete in one of three ways: 
    - Using a button at the end of the assignment.
    - From their :ref:`dashboard <accessing-your-courses>`.
    - Selecting **Mark as Completed" from the **Education** menu in the IDE.

You may decide to disable your students' ability to **Use Mark as Complete** if you have set the :ref:`assignment duration <assignment-duration>` 'On assignment End' action to **Mark as Complete** or **Disable assignment and Mark as Complete**.


Collapsed on Start
******************
Enabling this collapses the guides pane in an assignment/project when the :ref:`layout <page>` is not `1 Panel`. This performs a similar task to the :ref:`collapse <player-options>` button in playmode.

The guides can be reopened by clicking the index icon:
