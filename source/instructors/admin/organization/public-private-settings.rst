=========================================
The **Public/Private Settings** feature determines whether users can create public projects, stacks, starter packs, courses, and modules. By default, this setting is disabled where everything is created as private.

Follow these steps to enable Public/Private Settings:

1. Click your username in the top-right corner, then select **Organization** from the menu.

2. In the **Organizations** tab, click the name of your organization.

4. In the **Public/Private** area, toggle the **Public/Private Settings** to enable it. When enabled, members of your organization can only create private objects.


**Notes:**

- Private projects can still be shared with other users (See :ref:`Share Project <share-project>`).

- Any existing public projects, stacks, starter packs, courses, and modules created by members of the organization prior to changing this setting are not affected.
