Add Questions to an Assessment Library
======================================

You can add assessments to a library to reuse them across multiple projects and courses.


.. important:: Before you can add questions to an assessment library, an Admin in your organization must create an organization assessments library. See :ref:`Create an Organization Assessments Library <org-library>` for more information.

How to Add Questions to a Library
---------------------------------

1. Create the assessment (see :ref:`Add a New Assessment <add-assessment>`). Keep the following in mind:

   **Layout considerations:**
   
   - Assessments on pages using the :ref:`1 Panel without tree layout <layout>` are saved with a :ref:`simple layout <add-questions-from-library>`.

   **Tagging for searchability:**
   
   - Use the **Metadata** tab to tag your assessment so it appears when :ref:`searching the assessments library <search-library>`.

   **Including dependencies:**
   
   - Use the **Files** tab to include all dependent files (grading scripts, images, etc.) so the assessment works properly when added from the library.


2. Once the assessment is created, click **Save in Library** in the lower right corner on the assessment page.

.. note:: If you receive an error message, ensure that you have write access to your organization's assessment library. See :ref:`Create an Organization Assessments Library <org-library>` for more information.

5. Once a question has been added, follow the steps in :ref:`Update an Existing Assessment from Library <update-library>` to update your assessment with the newly added question.
