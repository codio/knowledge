Blueprints for Guide Pages
==========================

Use Blueprints to save your Markdown content and **Layout** settings as reusable templates for guide pages. When creating new pages, you can use these Blueprints to facilitate consistent styling and formatting across all your guides.

.. Note:: Blueprints are stored in courses and are available to all assignments in a course. They cannot be used in standalone projects.

Creating a **Blueprint**
------------------------
1. Enter the content, including the formatting and styling you want for the template.
2. Make your **Layout** selections.

Modifying an existing **Blueprint**
-----------------------------------
Modifying an existing **Blueprint** will overwrite its contents. To modify an existing **Blueprint** first create a page using that **Blueprint**, then make your changes. Select the name of the **Blueprint** you are modifying and click **Save**. A warning will display to let you know you are overwriting an existing template.

.. Note:: When you save a **Blueprint** it saves whatever you currently have on the guide page and in the layout.
