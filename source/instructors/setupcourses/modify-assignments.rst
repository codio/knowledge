Modify Assignments
==================
You can make changes to assignments that have already been published but it is not available to students until you re-publish it. There are certain considerations when making changes to assignments that students have already started to avoid invalidating their work.

4. When you have completed your changes, click **Publish** in the upper right corner of the assignment or from the **Education** menu area
5. Enter a description of your updates in the **Change Log** and then click **Publish**.

Re-publish assignment that students have already started

You can add new files but cannot update existing files as it will invalidate the student's work.
