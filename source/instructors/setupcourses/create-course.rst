Create a New Course
===================
To work with the course features in Codio, you must first set up a course for your students. You can author your own course or create a course using share code or add a course from Codio Courseware Catalog. Creating a course using share code is often used when you want to create a course from content outside your organization. You can also :ref:`clone a course <clone-course>`.

----------------------
To author your own course, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your Codio account.
2. Click the **Courses** menu at the top.
