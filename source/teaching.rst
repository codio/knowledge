Viewing student work
--------------------


As a teacher you have access to your students' assignments within Codio. This allows you to view and access work your students have completed at any time.

1. From the **Courses** area, click on your course to open it.

Writeable Copy
--------------
When you open a student project, changes you make will be saved in their project and they will see them when they open their projects. 

If you would like to try something out in their code without changing their version, click on the **WRITEABLE COPY** button on the top right. Changes made in this copy won't be saved.
