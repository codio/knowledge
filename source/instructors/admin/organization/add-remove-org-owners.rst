Add or Remove Organization Owners

The person who created the organization is automatically considered the Owner. However, you can add other owners with Admin permissions to perform administrator tasks. You can do this by adding a new user to your organization or adding an existing user as an Owner. Below are step-by-step instructions on adding an Owner via both options(Note: only an Owner can add Owners).
