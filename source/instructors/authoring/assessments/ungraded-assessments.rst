Ungraded Assessments
====================

You can create assessments that are not graded to provide a consequence-free way for students to check their understanding of the content.

To make an assessment ungraded, set both the correct and incorrect points to zero (0). No points will be added to or deducted from the student's overall grade for the assignment.
