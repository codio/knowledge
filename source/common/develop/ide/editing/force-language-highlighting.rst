Language Highlighting
=====================
Codio automatically selects the syntax highlighting rules based on the file extension. 


ECMAScript 6 support
--------------------

ECMAScript 6 is enabled by default in javascript files.

If you wish additional configurations to apply, you can add a `.jshintrc` file to the root of your project/assignment. See https://github.com/jshint/jshint/blob/master/examples/.jshintrc for more information
