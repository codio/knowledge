Search and Order Courses
========================
Courses are displayed in groups based on their creation date. The most recent course is displayed first. Courses are grouped as follows:

- Sep-Dec - Autumn
- Jan-May - Spring
- Jun-Aug - Summer

.. Note:: The season dividers can be turned off for the organization if required. See :ref:`Set Users Dashboard <default-student-dashboard>`

**My** and **All** tabs

The **My** tab will show all courses in which you are a **Teacher**.  This can be useful where you are in the **Owners** group and do not wish to see all the courses in the organization.
