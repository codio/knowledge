Extension Settings for a Course
===============================


You can enable Codio :ref:`Virtual Coach <virtual-coach>` extensions and custom :ref:`organization extensions <org-extensions>` on the course level from the **Extensions** tab in the **Admin** section of your Course menu. Extensions enabled at the course level cannot be disabled on the assignment level. If you prefer to selectively enable Extensions, you can do so at the assignment level or use the :ref:`bulk assignment update <bulk-assignment-update>` feature.
