Virtual Coach 
=============

The Virtual Coach can help you understand the error messages you have received, gain a better understanding of the assignment prompt, or receive a hint about the next possible steps.

Coach responses may be generated by AI, and students should carefully evaluate the recommendations provided.

To open Virtual Coach, click the Chatbot icon at the bottom-right corner of the screen. This icon will only be available if your teachers enable this feature.

When you open Virtual Coach, you will see up to three options depending on the settings applied. If there is no guide in the assignment, only error message augmentation will be available.
