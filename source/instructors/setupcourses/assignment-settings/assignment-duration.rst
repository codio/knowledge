Assignment Duration
===================
The **Assignment Duration** setting is used to specify a **Starting Date**, **Closing Date** and **Due Date** for the assignment, and what happens when the **Closing/Due Date** has been reached. The assignment is disabled until the start date/time and then it is displayed in the student dashboard. 

To set the assignment duration, follow these steps:

1. Open the assignment **Settings**.
2. Navigate to the **Assignment Duration** settings area.
3. Specify the assignment **Starting Date**, **Closing Date** and **Due Date** (optional):

   - Click the **Calendar** icon and select the date.
   - Click the **Clock** icon and select the time.

.. Note:: You can use the Due Date field in conjunction with :ref:`Penalties <penalties>` to give students extra time to work on an assignment with a reduced score. You do not need a separate Due Date if you do not intend to have a penalty period. Set the closing time for the assignment if you wish to end access at a specific date and time.
 
 Select the Mark as Completed on Due Date checkbox if you want all studentsâ€™ assignments to be marked as completed when the Due Date has been reached. This will ensure that students do not unintentionally receive penalties.

.. Note:: The time zone is automatically taken from the Course time zone, if you wish to change to a different time zone click the 'click here' link to open the Course Details settings. There you can change the time zone for all the assignments in the course.

4. Click the **When Assignment Closes** drop-down and choose one of the following options to indicate what happens when the **Closing Date** has been reached:

   - **Disable Assignment** (see :ref:`Disable Assignment <disable-assignment>`)
   - **Mark as Complete** (see :ref:`Visibility on Completed <visibility-completed>`)
   - **Disable Assignment and Mark as Complete**

5. Click **Save Changes**.

You can update this setting for multiple assignments in bulk, check out :ref:`Bulk Assignment Update <bulk-assignment-update>`.
