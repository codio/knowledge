Add or Remove Teachers in a Course
==================================

Your course may be taught by more than one teacher, so you can add teachers to your course. You can also enable a teacher to be a student in the course to test it. Follow these steps to add a teacher to your Codio course:

1. From the **Courses** page, select the course to open it.
2. Click the **Teachers** tab.
3. Click the **Add Teacher** button and enter their Codio username and click **Ok**.
4. If the teacher is not a member of your organization, or you don't know their Codio user name, use the field below.

5: If the teacher is not a member of your organization, you can send them an invitation email. Click the **Add Member** button and enter their email address and click **Send Invite**. An email is sent that includes a link for them to sign up for a Codio account. Upon completion, they are automatically added to your organization and course.

6. If you want to restrict the teacher to only be able to view the course but not edit its content, check the **Add this teacher as read-only** check box. You can change this later by clicking on the pencil icon.
