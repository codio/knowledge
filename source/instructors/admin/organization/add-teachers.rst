   * - **Teacher**
     - Will have standard teacher permissions.
   * - **Read-only teacher**
     - Will be prevented from making changes or edits to content but can still grade and perform all teacher functions. 
       This is an excellent option for teaching assistants (TAs).
   * - **Organization owner**
     - Will have full owner permissions. For more information, see :ref:`Add organization owner <org-owners>`.

5. Click **Send Invite**.

.. admonition:: What happens next? 

   An email is sent to the teacher that contains a link to sign up. Upon completing the sign up process, they are added to your organization.
    

.. note:: 
    They must use the same email address to which the invitation was sent; otherwise, they will not be added to the organization. This invitation is valid for 7 days. If it is not used within that time frame, it will expire, and the recipient will no longer be able to use it to join the organization. In such cases, you will need to resend the invitation. All pending invitations are displayed and you have the option to **Resend** or **Revoke** the invitation.


.. seealso:: 
   If you already have courses set up, you can add and invite teachers directly into your course(s). See :ref:`Add or Remove Teachers in a Course <add-teachers>`. You can then add them as an :ref:`Organization Owner <org-owners>` so they can then manage and create courses, and have full Admin access to the organization.
