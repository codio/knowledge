Create a Stack
==============
You can create a new stack or stack version from a project or assignment in the IDE, or from the **Stacks** page in the Codio dashboard.

.. Note:: Prior to creating a stack, read the information about :ref:`Stacks <stacks>` so you are familiar with how stacks work in Codio.

Stack guidelines
----------------
Before you create a stack, review the following strategies and considerations to improve their usefulness:

- Create a new project from a stack that most closely matches your requirements. You can also use the Base Stack and then :ref:`install your own components <box_parts>`.
- Include a full description of the stack; this is the description that is displayed in the **Stacks** listing and the stack info (**Projects > Stack > Info**) in a project. For a reference, review some of the Codio Certified Pack long descriptions.

Create a new stack from the IDE
-------------------------------
To create a new stack or new version of a stack from a project or assignment in the IDE, follow these steps:

1. Open the project in the IDE.

2. Click the **Project** tab on the menu bar and choose **Stack > Create New**. 

   .. image:: /img/stacks_createnew.png
      :alt: Stacks Create New

By default, the stack is Private. To make it available to others, refer to :ref:`Visibility and Ownership <stacks>`. We recommend that you set the owner to your organization.

Create a new stack from the dashboard
-------------------------------------
To create a new stack or new version of a stack from the Codio dashboard, follow these steps:

1. In the top menu bar, select **Stacks** from the **Build** menu.

2. On the **Stacks** page, click **New Stack** and point to your project.

   .. image:: /img/stacks_create.png
      :alt: Create New Stack

3. Complete the required fields: 

   - **Stack Blueprint** - Choose the Codio project to be used for the stack blueprint. Enter any part of the project name to view the blueprints in a drop-down list.
   - **Name and Description** - Enter a short name and a longer description for the stack. To add a more detailed overview of the stack, click the **add a long description** link. You can write the description using markdown.
   - **Image** - You can add an image to make your stack more instantly recognizable in the listing. The image should be square; the size will be reduced and appear in a circle.
   - **Tags** - You can add tags to the stack help ensure maximum search capabilities. Ideally, the tags should be component names. The autocomplete feature helps you find already defined tags to avoid duplication.

4. Click **Create** to generate the stack image (this may take a few minutes depending on the size of the image).

.. Note:: You do not need to remain on the page while the stack image is being created; you may continue to other areas of Codio. However, the source project is not accessible until the stack has been created.

Sample template
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Below is a sample template that can be modified for your stack.

.. code:: ini

    # Title
    Put the name of your Stack here.

    ## Using the Stack

    ## Starter Pack
    If there are related Starter Packs you have created from this Stack that include code files, detail them here.

    ## Components Installed
    It can be helpful to others or even to you later on to describe the installed Components and versions.

    ## Configuration Files
    Detail where any component configuration files can be found. As you install components from `Tools>Install Software` a log file of all this information will be opened.

    ## General Information
