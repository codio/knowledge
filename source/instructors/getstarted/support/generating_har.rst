Generating a HAR file for troubleshooting
=========================================

Codio Team may occasionally need additional information about the network requests that are generated in your browser. A member of the team may ask you to record a HAR file, or a log of network requests, while that issue occurs. It's helpful to include any browser console logs in addition to a HAR file. Similarly, you may also collect Windows log files in addition to HAR files.

.. Note:: A HAR file includes data such as the content of your cookies and the pages you downloaded while making the recording. Anyone with access to the HAR file can view the data submitted while recording, which may include personal data or other sensitive data. Make sure that you secure your HAR files accordingly. Cloudflare has released a `HAR sanitizer <https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-har-sanitizer-secure-har-sharing/>`_ that can be used to strip any sensitive information.

Instructions for sending HAR files
----------------------------------

Before you send a HAR file to Codio Team, you should both rename AND zip or compress your HAR files. Uncompressed HAR files are often over standard attachment limits. Also, by default, HAR files use the page URL as the name of the file. Files with .com extensions look suspicious to spam and phishing filters. Give the HAR file a descriptive name that doesn't include the full URL.
