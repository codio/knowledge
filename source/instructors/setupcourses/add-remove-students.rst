    - Copy the multi-word token and send to your students. Instruct your students to go to https://codio.com/p/join-class or click the **Join Course** button on our main website. They should enter the token and register their Codio account.
    
   - Copy the URL and send to your students. Instruct them to simply click the URL and register their Codio account.
   
   .. Note:: We would recommend the Student Invite URL option as all the students need to do is enter that URL into their browser to join the correct course in your organization.
      
   The students who have been added are displayed on the **Students** page for the course.

    .. Note:: Students cannot be enrolled while the organization is in trial mode. Please ensure your organization has an active subscription before adding students.
