Share Course
============

To share your course with others, follow these steps:

1. On the **Courses** page, select the course and then click the **Course Details** tab.

2. In the **Course Management** section, toggle the **Course share code** button to **On** and once you **Save Changes** a code is generated.

3. Click the **Copy to Clipboard** icon next to the code to share it with others.

To manage access to the course code, toggle the **Course share** code button to **Off** after you have shared the code, or click **Regenerate** to create a new code. When you regenerate a new code, the old code is disabled and can no longer be used.


When enabled you can also manage IP Consent by clicking the **Manage IP Consent** link offered.

You should first create the content that you wish to display. You enter your text in the lower portion of the screen. You can use markdown or HTML to format your text. If you are not familiar with markdown, here is a reference for markdown:

- `Daring Fireball <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics>`_ - the author of markdown

Press the **Save Draft** button to save your changes and continue editing later.

You can also **Preview** your changes to see how the rendered output appears.

When you are happy you can then publish and then **enable IP consent** that will then require teachers to accept your terms
