Search and Order Courses
========================
Courses are displayed in groups based on their creation date. The most recent course is displayed first. Courses are grouped as follows:

- Sep-Dec - Autumn
- Jan-May - Spring
- Jun-Aug - Summer

.. Note:: The season dividers can be turned off for the organization if required. See :ref:`Set Users Dashboard <default-student-dashboard>`

**My** and **All** tabs
-----------------------

The **My** tab will show all courses in which you are a **Teacher**.  This can be useful where you are in the **Owners** group and do not wish to see all the courses in the organization.

If you wish to see all the courses in the organization go to the **All** tab.

Sort courses
------------
You can sort the courses within the group by Name, Created Date, Student Count, or Start Date.

Search course
-------------
If you have a large number of courses, you can search by Name, Created Date, Student Count, or Start Date. Choose the sort option and then simply start typing your search criteria in the **Search** box. Codio searches all course names and filters your list accordingly.

You can use this feature to more easily view just courses you teach. Search for your username and **Add as Tab** as described below. 

Add as Tab
----------
To save your search parameters as a tab, click **Add as Tab**. Your search is then saved as a tab so you can quickly perform the same search again.
