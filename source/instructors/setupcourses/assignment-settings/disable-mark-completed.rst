Disable Mark as Completed
=========================
The **Disable Mark as Completed** setting is used to prevent students from marking an assignment as completed. If assignments in your course are of a playground type where students can experiment with their code, it's useful to enable this setting to prevent them from marking the assignment as completed, which would require you to reset the status so they can continue working on it.

**Note:** If your assignment contains guides content, you should disable this option to show the **Mark as Completed** button in guides.

To disable the mark as completed feature, follow these steps:

1. Open the assignment **Settings**.
2. In the **Assignment** settings, click the **Disable Mark as Completed.

   To enable student's ability to mark an assignment as completed, uncheck the **Disable Mark as Completed** setting.
3. Click **Save Changes**.
