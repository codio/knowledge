1. Enter the number of student licenses required.

2. Enter the student start date. 

3. If you have a promotion code, enter it in the appropriate field. Validation is case insensitive.

-  If the promotion code is invalid, the message
   ``Invalid promotion code`` will be shown
-  If the promotion code has expired, the message
   ``This promotion code has expired`` will be shown
-  Promotion codes are only available for new users and not available for student pay plans.

4. Enter a billing email address.

5. The plans available will be shown (semester or annual), select the plan you require and if you require the invoice to be sent to someone else, you can change the recipient.

6. When you are ready, click the 'Generate Invoice' button or 'Generate Quote' button as per your requirement, and the invoice or quote will be generated and sent to the email address.

  .. Note:: You can access your invoice from the email, or you can click **View Invoice** from the **Invoice History** section. Pay your invoice at this link.


Student Pay
-----------
The option to switch to a **Student Pay plan** where students are prompted to enter a credit card when they sign up is also available. Be aware if you have an annual plan and have already paid, this might lead to a conflict.

1. Navigate to the **Billing** page in your organization.

2. Click **Switch to Student Pay.** It will prompt you to confirm this action.

3. Students will now be prompted to make a payment when they access their Codio account, whether it be from Codio or from your LMS. 

4. To support students in this process, provide them with `this documentation link <https://docs.codio.com/students/accessing-codio/paying.html#pay-for-codio-subscription>`__ with specific emphasis to `this section <https://docs.codio.com/students/accessing-codio/paying.html#problems-setting-up-a-new-subscription-plan>`__ in the event they have problems especially if this may be first time they are trying to purchase online and the transaction may be refused by their bank due to the ever increasing fraud prevention measures card issuers are implementing or guide them to contact help@codio.com.  

Bookstore Pay
-------------
Codio offers the option to provide licenses through an institution's campus bookstore. This can ensure students on financial aid who need to buy licenses can do so through the bookstore. Students pay the bookstore for the license, the bookstore provides a redemption code, and students enter the code when they first access their Codio account. Codio then invoices the campus bookstore for codes purchased.

1. `Send this article <https://intercom.help/codio/en/articles/3609689-how-do-students-buy-codio-though-the-campus-bookstore>`_ to your bookstore manager to get the process started. 

2. To support students in this process, provide them with `this documentation <https://docs.codio.com/students/accessing-codio/paying.html#redeeming-code-from-campus-bookstore>`_ or guide them to contact help@codio.com.
